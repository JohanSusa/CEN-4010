Introduction
a. Description of the customer/setting for the project
i. Salient characteristics of the customer or sponsoring organization
ii. Description of the salient characteristics of the application/tool
1. What is the background of the project idea? What is the problem?
2. How is your application/tool different from what already exists?
3. What are the implications of the tool you develop? //Do not confuse this
with intention. Who (outside of the intended audience) can be affected by
your tool? What are some potential problems with such an application?
Does it have the potential for bias?
iii. Other important contextual issues, especially any external constraints placed on the
application/tool.
iv. Outline a proposed schedule for your project
1. A first draft that begins to show the development of your ideas as well as an assessment of its
social or societal need either with an actual customer or through scholarly literature. It will
also include a schedule and backlog (requirements).
2. A second draft that further develops your ideas. Ideally, this draft will contain the design of
your final project as well as incorporate feedback from previous draft.
3. A third and final draft that further develops your ideas. Ideally, this draft will contain the
verification plan of your final project as well as incorporate feedback from previous drafts.
**In order to receive credit for incorporating previous comments, you must address ALL of the
comments. You cannot “a la carte” the edits; this is an all or nothing effort.
4. A presentation of your project.

Semester Project
The principal assignment for the course is a group project (and paper). The actual project/digital artifact
(e.g., language, type, etc.) is left to the discretion of your team with an explicit explanation of decisions
captured in your project paper. The project paper is to be handed in Word or Pages format NOT .pdf (until
the final draft). This allows me to put comments in-line in the document. The production of the final
software engineering project paper will occur in a series of stages:
1. Show your backlog
2. Describe the process used to determine user story allocation (e.g.,
MoSCoW, Story Points, Planning Poker, Level of Effort, or any other
planning process.
3. Determine the sprint period (1 – 3 weeks)
a. Burndown chart
4. Allocate the backlog to the Sprints
*For Deliverable 1 demonstrate the allocation of user stories for at
least two sprints; however, this is a living document and should be
updated to reflect your progress during each deliverable. Meaning for
deliverable 2, you should have more than two sprints planned.
i. The user stories should follow the format: As a ,<type of
user>, I want <some goal>, so that <some reason>.
ii. It should also be followed by a set of Acceptance Criteria
v. Describe your team and the proposed roles and responsibilities for your teammates.
How do you plan to distribute the work amongst your team considering things like
– time constraints, skill set, etc.
b. Your motivation for selecting this project
i. Your own expertise in the area
ii. How this might be useful to you in your career

2. Design
a. Define design – find a peer reviewed published element to cite here using APA formatting
(https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_g
uide/general_format.html). This includes peer reviewed journal articles, textbooks, etc.
b. Introduce your design process
c. Demonstrate the design graphically for the system level (use case and class diagram) and two
sprints worth of UML diagrams (this will vary from team to team).
i. Use cases
ii. Activity Diagrams (if applicable)
iii. Class Diagrams
iv. Sequence diagrams
d. Rationale Management – be sure to provide a justification for at least two design
decisions made during the project (hint* - take notes as you are going through the process,
journal even...this will help you with this portion of the project).
i. The issues that were addressed
ii. The alternatives that were considered
iii. The decisions that were made to resolve the issues
iv. The criteria used to guide decisions
v. The debate developers went through to reach a decision

3. Verification
a. Define verification
b. Introduce your verification process
c. Describe/demonstrate one system level testcase – system level testcases ONLY (no unit
testing necessary)
4. Reflection
a. In one or two paragraphs, discuss the lessons you learned individually during this project
(e.g., teamwork, project selection, software life cycle, implications, schedule) – there should
be one-to-two paragraphs per team member
i. Share the actual timeline for execution of the project. Compare the proposed
schedule with the actual timeline. Describe and explain the deviation from the
planned or proposed.

SUGGESTED TOOLS:
Tracking tool – Asana, Trello
Design diagrams – draw.io
TEAM SELECTION: Complete the CATME poll to aid in team selection. The tool is available Week 1.
You will receive an email when the survey is available. CATME will also be utilized for team evaluations.
There will be three team evaluations – 1st deliverable, 2nd deliverable, and year end. Completion of the
CATME surveys will be counted as part of your participation grade.
ACCOMODATIONS: If you are a person with special circumstances that you believe will affect your class
performance (e.g., visual, hearing or learning disabilities or language differences) please let me know if I can
make appropriate accommodations. The Disability Resource Services website is located at:
